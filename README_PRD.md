## 1. Product Definition

### 1.1 What is TDOP?

TDOP is a **trusted opportunity discovery and progress platform** for Tanzania.

It is not a job board. It is a structured ecosystem connecting opportunity seekers with opportunity providers, built around the core journey:

```
PROFILE → DISCOVER → UNDERSTAND → MATCH → TRUST → APPLY → TRACK → OUTCOME
```

### 1.2 The Problem

Opportunity information in Tanzania is fragmented across government websites, company sites, NGOs, universities, social media, WhatsApp groups, job boards, and recruitment agencies. This creates:

- **Discoverability gaps** — suitable opportunities missed
- **Trust deficits** — legitimacy uncertain
- **Information quality issues** — incomplete, outdated, misleading listings
- **Relevance problems** — poor matching to skills, education, location
- **Application complexity** — unclear eligibility, requirements, methods
- **Deadline misses** — legitimate opportunities lost

### 1.3 The Solution

TDOP provides:

- Structured opportunity listings with eligibility, requirements, and deadlines
- Organization verification with evidence-based trust signals
- Profile-based matching and recommendations
- Application tracking and status management
- Moderation and anti-fraud protections
- Multi-channel notifications (in-app, email; SMS, WhatsApp, push planned)

## 12. Architectural Principles

### 12.1 Backend Authoritative

Frontend is not a security boundary. All authorization enforced server-side.

### 12.2 RBAC Model

```
ROLE → PERMISSION → RESOURCE → ACTION → SCOPE
```

### 12.3 Organization Isolation

Organization A must never access Organization B's protected resources.

### 12.4 Evidence-Based Trust

Verification supported by evidence and auditable decisions.

### 12.5 No Fabricated Data

Production UI must not display fabricated metrics, testimonials, organizations, or analytics.

### 12.6 One Source of Truth

Avoid duplicate APIs, dashboards, domain models, business rules, workflows, routes, services.

### 12.7 Reuse Before Rebuild

Existing working functionality should be reused unless there is a demonstrated architectural reason to replace it.

### 12.8 Domain-Driven Architecture

Clear separation: Identity, Organization, Trust, Opportunity, Action, Outcome, Discovery, Communication, Governance, Intelligence.

## 13. Documentation Status Model

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **CURRENT** | Exists in current repository implementation |
| **PARTIAL** | Partially implemented, needs completion |
| **PLANNED** | Designed but not yet coded |
| **FUTURE** | Visionary, no design yet |
| **DEFERRED** | Intentionally postponed |

Where useful, wording such as "target architecture" and "current repository implementation" distinguishes future from present.
